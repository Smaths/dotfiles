## Notes
> [!WARNING]  
> All files are configured for ARM chips. Homebrew installation differs between x86 (Intel) and ARM (Apple Silicon), so the `.zshrc` and other files may need their locations corrected if installing these config files onto a different chipset than the one that was used to create these config files.
